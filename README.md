## Sandbox
For sandbox judge0 is using [Isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate) (licensed under [GPL v2](https://github.com/ioi/isolate/blob/master/LICENSE)).

>Isolate is a sandbox built to safely run untrusted executables, offering them a limited-access environment and preventing them from affecting the host system. It takes advantage of features specific to the Linux kernel, like namespaces and control groups.

Huge thanks to [Martin Mare≈°](https://github.com/gollux) and [Bernard Blackham](https://github.com/bblackham) for developing and maintaining Isolate. Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/ioi/isolate/graphs/contributors) for their contributions to Isolate project.

Isolate was used as a sandbox environment (part of [CMS](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms) system) on big programming contests like [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml) (a.k.a. IOI) in 2012, and we trust that it works and does its job.
